# claude-config

A repository for managing Claude Code global settings.

Syncs via **file copy** through a script — no symlinks into `~/.claude/`.

## Managed Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Global behavior instructions (applied to all projects) |
| `settings.json` | Model, permissions, hooks, and other runtime settings |

## New Machine Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:WoojinAhn/claude-config.git ~/path/to/claude-config
cd ~/path/to/claude-config
./sync.sh setup
```

`setup` will:
1. Show diff between repo and `~/.claude/` for each managed file
2. Ask whether to overwrite each file (local file is backed up as `*.bak`)
3. Install `push-config.sh` into `~/.claude/` (used by the auto-push hook)

## Usage

```bash
# Show diff between repo and ~/.claude/
./sync.sh diff

# Pull: remote -> ~/.claude/ (also reinstalls push-config.sh)
./sync.sh pull

# Push: ~/.claude/ -> remote (manual)
./sync.sh push

# Check sync status
./sync.sh status
```

## Auto-Push

The `settings.json` hook triggers `~/.claude/push-config.sh` on every `Write|Edit` in Claude Code sessions. This script is generated by `setup` with the repo path baked in — no hardcoded paths in committed files.

## Adding Files

Add filenames to the `FILES` array in `sync.sh` to include them in sync.

```bash
FILES=("CLAUDE.md" "settings.json" "keybindings.json")
```
